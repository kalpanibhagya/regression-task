# Welcome to EnerKey coding challenge!
Regression task is a work in progress analysis for a list of facilities written with Python.

## Decriptions
This repository contains two python files: regression_task.py & data_reader.py. Repository also has three different csv files, which contain the data for analysis.

regression_task.py is the file that contains the tasks to complete. If you don't have data science packages installed, there is requirements.txt file containing required packages.

Your goal is to model the relationship with temperature data and watts per square. You need to manipulate various dataframes and understand linear regression a bit to succeed.

## Tasks
There are 5 tasks:
- Task 1: Joining the temperature and consumptions
- Task 2: Filter out saturdays and sundays
- Task 3: Calculate W/m2
- Task 4: Use linear regression
- Task 5: Plot the results

## Other
You have complete freedom on how to handle the implementations. The provided functions in the regression_task, can act as a guide, but you are free to do this in any way.

There is no need to create unit/integrations tests.
